/**
 * Renders an icon based on the properties "icon" and "group".
 *
 * There are three icon groups:
 * - outline: most of the icons are in this group. The icons are stroke only.
 * - fill: most outline icons have a fill version. Fill icons are filled with solid colors, they're not just strokes.
 * - social: icons for brands (logos).
 *
 * By default, the group is "outline".
 *
 * The icon size depends on the font-size of the current context. To set a specific size, use the property "size".
 *
 * Attention: this is the same as using the component Icon from the icons component, the only difference is that this accepts the property
 * "color".
 *
 * @example
 *
 * ```
 * <Icon icon="Search" />
 * ```
